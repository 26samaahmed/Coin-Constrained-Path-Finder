# Coin-Constrained Path Finder

## ⟡ Project Statement  
Coin-Constrained Path Finder is an interactive GUI application where users select a starting city, a destination, and a total number of available coins. Each path between cities has two associated values: **distance** and **coin cost**. We use the **A\*** algorithm to find the shortest feasible path while respecting the coin constraint. The GUI visualizes the algorithm in real time, **displays the paths explored**, and **highlights the optimal route generated by the AI**.

## ⟡ Purpose of Files

### **main.py**
- Application entry point that initializes the graph, creates the GUI window, and starts the application.

### **gui.py**
- Creates the interactive game interface with a dual-panel layout. 
- Handles user input, click-to-move gameplay, real-time visualization of the graph, and displays comparisons between user paths and AI-generated optimal solutions.

### **nodes.py**
- Defines the City class representing individual nodes in the graph. 
- Each city stores its name, heuristic value, and connections to neighboring cities with their associated distance and coin costs.

### **graph.py**
- Manages the overall graph structure, storing all cities and their positions.
- Provides methods to add cities, create connections, and includes factory functions to generate pre-configured graph layouts with different strategic trade-offs, taking into consideration distance and coin constraints.

### **pathfinder.py**
- Implements the A* search algorithm with coin constraints. 
- Finds the optimal path between nodes while respecting the coin budget, tracking visited nodes and explored paths for visualization purposes.

## ⟡ Tools Used  
- Python  
- Tkinter for building the graphical user interface

## ⟡ Algorithms Used  
◌ Graphs (nodes with names, heuristics, and weighted connections)  
◌ A* search algorithm adapted with coin constraints  
◌ Priority queues (via `heapq`) for efficient node selection
